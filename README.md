Metatranscriptomics is an exciting new area of inquiry with important applications in medical and environmental science fields, among others. By analyzing the RNA of a biological community--perhaps that of an organism's microbiome or free-living marine microbes--we can determine which genes are actually being expressed by the community, and, therefore, which functions the organisms in that community are actively carrying out.
